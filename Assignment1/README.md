# Bookstore Database

## Description

This assignment involved designing and querying a relational database for a bookstore. The schema includes four interconnected tables: `Authors`, `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders`. The goal was to write a variety of SQL queries to extract, analyze, and manipulate data.

## Database Structure

- **Authors**: Contains author information such as name, country, and birth year.
- **Books**: Contains book details including title, genre, price, stock, and links to authors.
- **Customers**: Stores customer information like name, email, join date, and country.
- **Orders**: Tracks book purchases, with details like customer, book, quantity, and total price.

## What I Learned

- **Basic SQL Queries**: Selecting, filtering, and sorting data.
- **JOINs**: Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`.
- **Aggregations**: Using functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` to compute totals and averages.
- **Grouping & Filtering**: Working with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to analyze grouped data.
- **Subqueries**: Writing nested queries for more advanced data retrieval.
